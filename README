A simple dispatch table to generate child objects based on a text index.
Each object has a different set of parameters associated with it.

No use is made of "if/else" statements.


Building:

  make
  make run


Improvements:

  * Store node_ptr objects in a vector for later use rather
    than simply printing them out to a stream.

  * Add additional object types.
